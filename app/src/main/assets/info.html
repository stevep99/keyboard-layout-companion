<p>Keyboard Layout Companion is a tool for visualizing and generating images of alternative keyboard layouts and designs.</p>

<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>The app works in three different modes, selectable via the <i>Mode</i> dropdown:<br/>
- <b>Display:</b> for visualizing and editing keyboard layouts.<br/>
- <b>Score:</b> for calculating an "effort grid" for a keyboard for use in Keyboard Analyzer programs. The algorithm used for the calculation is defined in the <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/model.html">Colemak-DH Model</a> page.<br/>
- <b>Distance:</b> for calculating the travel distance for each key for its respective home finger, as measured using the algorithm described above.<br/>

<h3>Editing</h3>

The positions of keys can moved using drag-and-drop on the keyboard view. Tapping a key toggles the fade state. For more detailed editing, such as adding layers or adjusting key colours, a keyboard definition file must be copied to the device's SD Card, details below.

<h3>Keyboard Geometries</h3>

<p>A number of common keyboard physical geometries are supported, including ANSI (common in North America), ISO (common in Europe), and JIS (common in Japan). Also supported are a selection of matrix-like keyboards. You can also create custom keyboard geometries.</p>

<p>The app also allows you to view additional variations of the most common keyboard geometries, including the <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/wide.html">Wide Mod</a> and <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html">Angle Mod</a>.</p>

<p>To add extra geometries: Create a geometry definition JSON file on the SD Card in the location:<br/>
    <code>/sdcard/keyboard/geometries</code>
</p>

<h3>Layouts</h3>

<p>Keyboard layouts are mappings between the physical key and the output that is produced when that key is typed. A wide variety of alternative layouts are included by default, but you can also add your own. Each layout can have one or more <i>layers</i> defined. If more than one layer is defined in a layout, controls will be shown making it possible to cycle through the available layers. It also possible to configure the default key background colour.</p>

<p>To add extra layouts create a layout definition text file on the SD Card in the location:<br/>
    <code>/sdcard/keyboard/layouts</code>
</p>

<h3>Other Options</h3>

<p>The "Filter" dropdown allows only a chosen portion of the keyboard to be rendered.</p>

<p>The "split" checkbox will render a version of the keyboard with left- and right-hand sides split. The spacebar will also be split into two in this case.</p>

<p>The "styles" checkbox allows any extra styling on the keys to be shown, such as home key indicators or fading.</p>

<p>The "fingers" checkbox causes the displayed keyboard to be colour-coded by finger used for each key. When deselected, the colours defined in the layout definition file will used if defined, or otherwise, by key type.</p>

<p>The "Settings" button on the titlebar allows keyboard images to be generated using either of two types key graphics: a "rounded" style, designed by <a href="https://github.com/stevep99">SteveP</a>, and used on the <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak-DH</a> site; or a "square" style designed by <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR">DreymaR</a> and used in <a href="https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL">EPKL</a>.</p>

<p>The Title Bar contains buttons to print the current keyboard to an image file, and to write the current layout as a text file. The files are saved on the SDCard in the location:<br/>
    <code>/sdcard/keyboard/output</code>
</p>
